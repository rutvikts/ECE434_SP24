# ECE434_SP24

UIUC ECE 434 - Real-World Algorithms Assignments Repository

## Setting up the environments
Firstly setup Conda if you haven't already: [Conda Setup](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)

For MP2 onwards Conda is used to manage the python package dependencies. Change directory into the directory of the MP you would like to run and run the following line in your terminal to setup the environment:

```console
foo@bar:~$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Then to activate an environment (must use specific environment name specified in the environment.yml file):

Example for MP4:

```console
foo@bar:~$ conda activate ECE434_MP4_env
```

If using VS Code, you may need to close and reopen the IDE to see the new environment.

To deactivate an environment:

```console
foo@bar:~$ conda deactivate  
```
